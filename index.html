        <h1>THE HOOD<br><span>RAMSEY SHOW</span></h1>
        <p>What it do I'm Hood Ramsey. Who Am I you ask well I'm a Brooklyn Born and raised in the hood. Growing up there was not many options to eat from but most importantly i was picky with what i ate. Being from a very private and secluded background i never got a chance to try out alot of food. i had ketchup for the first time two years ago, never had mayo or any white sauce, never had mustard i could go on but i do not even know the names of things i haven't tried so i am on a journey and you guys are going to pick the food and i'll rate and let you know if its worth trying and for what occassion to get the most out of your time out.</p>

        <h1>Food Hood Ramsey<br><span>don't like (my opinion)</span></h1>
        <p>ketchup although i do not remeber the taste it was not to good, mediterranean food from coney island in brooklyn it was dookie, the passion fruit bubble tea on coney island. Come to think of it coney island producing hot poop in the food department step it up. this is a update on my most hated food i'll keep you posted. 8.24.21 HR approved. </p>
